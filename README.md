# 🏅 Olympics Data Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores Olympic Games data from 1976 to 2008, analyzing trends in medal distribution, athlete performance, gender participation, and country-wise dominance. It also includes a predictive model to estimate medal-winning probabilities.

## 📊 Key Focus Areas
Medal Distribution: Analyzing which countries dominated the Olympics.
Athlete Performance: Identifying top-performing athletes.
Gender Trends: Examining the increase in female participation.
Medal Trends Over the Years: Identifying spikes and declines due to participation and political factors.
Predictive Analysis: Using Logistic Regression to estimate medal chances based on factors like country, sport, and gender.
🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Programming: Python
Data Analysis: SQL, Excel
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression
## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of Olympic medal winners from 1976 to 2008 with key attributes:

City, Year, Sport & Discipline
Athlete Name, Country, Medal Type
Gender
## 🔧 Data Processing
Missing Values: Removed null values from key columns.
Standardization: Converted data types, removed duplicates, and formatted names.
Feature Engineering: Added new insights like total medals won, gender ratio, and athlete performance trends.
## 📈 Key Insights
1.) Top Performing Countries: USA, Soviet Union, China.
2.) Most Popular Sports: Athletics, Swimming, Gymnastics.
3.) Gender Trends: Significant rise in female participation post-1980, though some events remain male-dominated.
4.) Medal Trends: Political and economic factors influenced performance, with some countries declining after 1990.
5.) Machine Learning Prediction: Achieved 75% accuracy in predicting medal winners, with country and sport type being the most influential factors.
## 🚀 Next Steps
